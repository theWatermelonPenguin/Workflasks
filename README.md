"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently what should not be done at all." - Peter Drucker.

Sure, you may be able to write 100 emails. That's very efficient. But when you can have a machine automate it (or this software), all that efficiency is wasted.

Workflasks is made for that struggle -  to automate YOUR ðŸ«µ tedious tasks!
